## **Skills & Proficiency:**
I am a cost estimator in construction who decided to change profession after 10 years of working.  Several month ago I understood  that I have only one working  experience in my life and I want to change something, to learn something new. IT professions are the one of the most well-paid professions in my country so I decided to try one of them. I found HTML-academy in the Internet and started to solve tasks in this course to understand if I like such an unusual way of thinking for me. And now since I started there I decided to try full-fledged courses at the Rolling Scopes School. My skills are not so outstanding but I have a great desire to learn more. I completed 65% tasks for beginners at HTML-academy so I got some idea of HTML, CSS and JS.
